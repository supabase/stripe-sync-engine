# Stripe Sync Engine (Experimental)

Continuously synchronizes a Stripe account to a Postgres database.

Note: this is experimental. There are no guarantees that it will be supported in the future.

![Sync Stripe with Postgres](./docs/stripe-sync-engine.jpg)
## Motivation

Sometimes you want to analyze your billing data using SQL. Even more importantly, you want to join your billing data to your product/business data.

This server synchronizes your Stripe account to a Postgres database. It can be a new database, or an existing Postgres database.
## How it works

![How it works](./docs/sync-engine-how.png)

- Creates a new schema `stripe` in a Postgres database, with tables & columns matching Stripe.
- Exposes a `/webhooks` endpoint that listens to any Stripe webhooks.
- Inserts/updates/deletes changes into the tables whenever there is a change to Stripe.

**Not implemented**

- This will not do an initial load of existing Stripe data. You should use CSV loads for this. We might implement this in the future.
- We are progressively working through webhooks.

## Usage

- Update your Stripe account with all valid webhooks and get the webhook secret
- `mv .env.sample .env` and then rename all the variables
- Make sure the database URL has search_path `stripe`. eg: `DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@hostname:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable&search_path=stripe`
- Deploy the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/supabase/stripe-sync-engine) to your favourite hosting service and expose port `8080`
  - eg: `docker run -e PORT=8080 --env-file .env supabase/stripe-sync-engine`
  - This will automatically run any migrations on your database
- Point your Stripe webooks to your deployed app.
## Future ideas

- Expose a "sync" endpoint for each table which will manually fetch and sync from Stripe.
- Expose an "initialize" endpoint that will fetch data from Stripe and do an initial load (or perhaps `POST` a CSV to an endpoint).

## Development

**Set up**
- Create a Postgres database on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) (or another Postgres provider)
- Update Stripe with all valid webhooks and get the webhook secret
- `mv .env.sample .env` and then rename all the variables
- run `dbmate up` to run all the database migrations

**Develop**

- `npm run dev` to start the local server
- `npm run test` to run tests

**Building Docker**

```bash
docker build -t stripe-sync-engine .
docker run -p 8080:8080 stripe-sync-engine
```
**Release**
